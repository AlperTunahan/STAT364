Credit Card Usage

Credit cards are an essential and irreplaceable part of our lives because of their advantages and fastness among methods of payment. “Credit cards allow people to take money from the bank with the credit limit without any costs, and this includes all the time and effort involved with obtaining a loan from a financial association. This simplicity allows many consumers to pay more interest rates on exceptional credit card balances, instead of spending time applying for a loan with a lower interest rate. To conclude, credit cards account for a substantial and growing share of people's debt” (Canner and Luckett 1992).  
If someone is aged over 18, he/she can easily apply for a credit card and get it. He/she can arrange the credit card limit according to income. Credit card owners can spend their money, however, whenever they want as much as their credit card limit, even without cash, and this is the most important point of the credit card. Then, at the end of the month, people must pay the money they spent whether in one payment or pay by installment with an extra interest rate. Also, if people do not pay their credit card debts for a long time, banks add an additional interest rate to credit cards. 
There are many banks with various offers for credit cards such as special offers, method of payments, interest rates. “We need to make a point here that we are not talking against the constant use of some credit cards of banks, on the contrary, we say that these uses of cards may lead to benefits for payment purposes. Hence, we know that banks can offer which is user’s benefits such as points that can be applied to travel, vacation, discount, or other rewards”(Sarofim, S., Chatterjee, P., & Rose, R. (2020)).
